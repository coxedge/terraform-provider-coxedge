This property specifies the response status codes for which calls to the backup origin must not be made. Multiple response codes can be excluded. e.g: ["410", "411", "412"]. Asterisks can be used to cover a range of codes. e.g. All the 4xx codes can be covered using "4*".

- `origin` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--origin)) - The primary origin that the CDN uses to pull content from.
- `pull_protocol` (String) - The type of protocol used to pull content from the origin. Must be one of ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "MATCH"]. "MATCH" is equivalent to "HTTP or HTTPS".
- `site_id` (String) - The ID of the site for which to list delivery domains. This parameter is required.
- `ssl_validation_enabled` (String) - Specifies if SSL validation for the origins is enabled.
- `websockets_enabled` (String) - Specifies if web socket connections to the origin server are enabled.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `scope_configuration_id` (String) - The ID of the scope of the site that the origins are connected to.
